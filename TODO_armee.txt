#generate almost all possible senetence requests by the user FOR THE DATASET used to TRAIN an NLP model
#each sentence includes topic (A,C,G,N), Quantity (up to 8, either in symbol or word), Tags, and rating
#so u should also create tags (at least as samples for now) in a new file
#for eg, there can be like "can/could/would/do  you/u  (pls)  recommend/give/suggest  me  3/eight/one numberTheory/nt problems with 3 rating (related to) modulos/fermat's little theorem?
#for eg, i wanna/would like to/want to  try/solve/do  4/two combi problems in counting/invariant around four rated.
#u should also consider all possibilities for topic like geo/geometry/geometery for geometry and NT/numberTheory/number_theory for Number numberTheory
#U dont need to explicitly obey all above tho since this is for dataset.
#the generated dataset should be at least 1000 sentences.
#dont screw too much over one structure.
#Tip u can structure each part of the sentence with lists, and store possibilities in the list, later go through multiple loops.
